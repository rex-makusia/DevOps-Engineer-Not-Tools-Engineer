## 71.Diagnostic frameworks: 
Develop systematic approaches to troubleshooting that work across different technology stacks.

## 72.Hypothesis-driven investigation: 
Apply the scientific method to technical issues, forming and testing theories about root causes.

## 73.Pattern recognition: 
Train yourself to identify recurring patterns in seemingly different problems to apply consistent solutions.

## 74.Problem decomposition: 
Break complex challenges into smaller, manageable pieces that can be solved independently.

## 75.Edge case identification: 
Develop instincts for identifying boundary conditions and exceptional scenarios before they cause production issues.

## 76.Solution comparison: 
Evaluate multiple potential solutions against consistent criteria rather than defaulting to familiar tools.

## 77.Risk assessment: 
Understand how to quantify and compare different types of technical risk to make appropriate trade-offs.

## 78.Recovery planning: 
Design not just for preventing failures but for recovering quickly when they inevitably occur.

## 79.Performance bottleneck identification: 
Develop methodical approaches to identifying performance limitations regardless of the technology stack.

## 80.Experiment design: 
Create controlled experiments to validate hypotheses about system behavior and potential improvements.
