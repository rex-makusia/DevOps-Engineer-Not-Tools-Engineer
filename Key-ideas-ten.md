## 91. Engineering culture building
Foster environments that value engineering excellence over tool proficiency or certification collection.

## 92. Psychological safety
Create team dynamics where it's safe to admit knowledge gaps and focus on learning fundamentals over appearing expert.

## 93. Hiring for potential
Evaluate candidates based on engineering aptitude and learning ability rather than specific tool experience.

## 94. Balanced teams
Build teams with diverse engineering backgrounds rather than specialists in the same narrow toolset.

## 95. Knowledge sharing structures
Implement systems for preserving and transferring core engineering knowledge as team composition changes.

## 96. Learning organization: Create organizational habits that encourage continuous deep learning rather than superficial tool familiarity.

## 97. Principled pragmatism: Balance theoretical purity with practical delivery, making compromises explicit and intentional.

## 98. Technical vision communication: Articulate compelling engineering visions that inspire teams beyond tool adoption roadmaps.

## 100. Intellectual curiosity: Nurture environments where asking "why" and exploring fundamentals is valued as much as immediate problem-solving.

Long-term thinking: Make technical decisions with awareness of long-term consequences beyond immediate project deadlines or current tool lifecycles.
