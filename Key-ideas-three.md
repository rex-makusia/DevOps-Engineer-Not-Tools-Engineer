## 21.Failure engineering
Design for failure modes and recovery at the system level, beyond what individual resilience tools provide.

## 22.Platform thinking
Build capabilities and abstractions that empower others rather than creating tool dependencies that centralize control.

## 23.Data-driven decisions 
Base technology choices on quantifiable benefits rather than following industry trends or using what's familiar.

## 24.First principles reasoning
Develop the habit of breaking down problems to their fundamental elements before applying solutions.

## 25.Technical empathy
Understand the challenges and constraints faced by other roles to build more effective end-to-end solutions.

## 26.Constraint identification
Recognize when your actual limitations are conceptual rather than tool-related, and focus energy accordingly.

## 27.Cost optimization
Consider financial implications of engineering decisions beyond tool licensing feesâ€”including operational overhead and maintenance costs.

## 28. Knowledge transfer systems
Create processes for sharing core engineering insights rather than just tool-specific knowledge.

## 29.Future-proofing strategies 
Design systems that can evolve as needs change, avoiding deep coupling to technologies that may become obsolete.

## 30.Simplicity as a feature 
Value clean, understandable solutions over complex ones, recognizing that simplicity often requires deeper engineering skill.
