## 51.Evolutionary architecture 
Design systems that can evolve over time instead of requiring complete rebuilds when requirements change.

## 52.Interface stability
Create stable interfaces between components that allow implementation details to change without cascading impacts.

## 53. Deployment independence
Design services that can be deployed independently to reduce coordination overhead and increase delivery speed.

## 54. Failure isolation 
Implement bulkheads and other patterns to contain failures regardless of the specific infrastructure platform.

## 55. Configuration philosophy 
Develop a coherent approach to configuration management based on environmental context, not tied to specific tools.

## 56.Observability foundations 
Build systems with rich context emission that enables understanding behavior, not just detecting issues.

## 57.Scaling principles
Understand horizontal vs. vertical scaling trade-offs that apply across all infrastructure solutions.

## 58.Consistency boundaries
Identify appropriate transaction and consistency boundaries based on business needs, not technical limitations.

## 59.Legacy integration patterns
Develop approaches for integrating with legacy systems that respect their constraints while enabling evolution.

## 60.Service granularity 
Make deliberate decisions about service size and responsibility boundaries based on domain considerations.
